Liftkopf is an application to collect, store and statistically evaluate the score of Doppelkopf games played.
It is destined to be the heir of webkopf, a similar application written some years ago in PHP.

It will provide an advanced web interface and a RESTful web service API to handle all kinds of different client
applications.
